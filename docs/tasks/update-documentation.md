# Documentation Update Task

Read the following documents:

- docs/design-record.md
- README.md
- AGENTS.md

After reading the documents, read all the \*.go files. Ignore the ./reference directory if it exists.

Discuss any discrepancies with me. The design documents should match the code, and vice versa.

If we decide to make changes and they are approved, update the documents or code as needed.
